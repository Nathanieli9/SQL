--Here I'm querying a database with multiple tables including a customer info table, as well as tables with corresponding order info.

--How many orders were place in January?
SELECT count(*) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

----Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity) as amount_sold, sum(quantity)*price as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(*), avg(FebSales.quantity*FebSales.price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2;
